## [Full Stack Application Development Project V2](https://github.com/Styner2023/xrwvm-fullstack_developer_capstone)
### Full Stack Application Development Project
I successfully completed this capstone project as part of the IBM Full Stack Developer Professional Certificate. In this project, I designed and implemented a dynamic user experience using REACT, Python, Django, MongoDB, Node.js, Docker, and Kubernetes. The project involved building, testing, and deploying a micro-services based application. I also utilized GitHub and GitHub Actions for code maintenance and version management, demonstrating my proficiency in full stack development.

### Built with C++
This project showcases my skills in C++ through the development of a comprehensive ToDo list application. The application features task creation, editing, and deletion, with a focus on a user-friendly interface and efficient performance. This project allowed me to demonstrate my ability to design and implement software solutions in C++.

## [Voice of Power](https://github.com/Styner2023/Voice_of_Power)
### Empowering Voices through Technology
Voice of Power is a web application I developed to enable users to upload PDF books and have them read aloud using Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology. The application supports multiple languages, various voices, and two reading speeds.
